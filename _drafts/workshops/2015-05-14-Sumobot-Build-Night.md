Who doesn't love fighting robots?  In the Sumo bot workshop everyone built a bot
based upon the [sumobot-jr](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr) project.

## Controlling the Sumo Bot

To control the Sumo bots the organizers have created apps for Android, iOS, and
Windows Phone.

</div>

The app connects to the Sumo bot over blue tooth LE.  The two sliders in the app
control the wheels of the bot and there is also a GPIO button which can be used
with your customizations.

## Customization & Fight Night

Now that everyone has completed their Sumo bots everyone will have 2 weeks to
customize their bots before [fight night](http://www.meetup.com/Make-on-the-Lake/events/220104737/).

### Rules of Fight Night

Fighting will take place on one of three arenas chosen at random.  The three
arenas will feature unique terrain and each will prove to be a unique challenge
to the competitors.
