Teddy is an internet of things (IoT) teddy bear.  Using a [Spark core](https://www.particle.io/)
and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) Teddy is programed to celebrate any time that
you tweet to our Twitter account ([@MakeOnTheLake](https://twitter.com/MakeOnTheLake)).

Teddy is equipped with 2 servos to move his arms, 2 LEDs to light up his eyes,
a speaker to make sound, and a button to set him off without having to tweet.
